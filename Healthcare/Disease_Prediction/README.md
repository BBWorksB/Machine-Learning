# Disease Prediction
- Will build a robust machine learning model that willl predict a disease from the symptomps of the patients. We will approach the model in this manner:
* Gathering data - will use the kaggle dataset, it has two CSV files for training and testing dataset. 
* Cleaning dataset - Clean data means accurate and better model
* Model building - 
* Inference - 

Finally we will be defining a function that takes symptoms separated by commas as input, predict the disease based on the symptoms by using the trained models , and returns the predictions in JSON format
